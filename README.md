# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my progression learning Python through Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" bootcamp and other resources. Each project represents different skills I've acquired along the way.

## About This Repository

This collection documents my Python learning journey, completed independently in my free time outside of university coursework. All projects follow Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" and represent my personal implementation of the challenges.

## My Learning Journey

As a Python programmer relearning python fundamentals, each project represents my personal interpretation of the exercise instructions provided in the course.  

## Beginner Projects
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- **[Treasure Island Game](./01-beginner-projects/treasure-island)**: A text-based adventure game using conditional statements
  - In this simple text-based game, players make choices that determine whether they find the treasure or meet an unfortunate end.
  - **Game Description**  
    In Treasure Island, players navigate through a series of choices:
      1. Choose whether to go left or right at a crossroads
      2. Decide whether to swim across a lake or wait for a boat
      3. Select one of three colored doors (Red, Blue, or Yellow)
   
     Only one path leads to the treasure, while wrong choices result in creative "game over" scenarios!
  - **Skills Practiced**
    1. Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
    2. User input handling
    3. String comparison
    4. ASCII art for visual feedback
    5. Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
  - **How to Run**  
    Simply run the Python script in your terminal:
    ```
    python treasure_island.py
    ```

## Future Goals

- Continue adding projects as I complete them
- Revisit earlier projects to enhance them with new skills
- Explore personal project ideas using Python
- Implement more advanced features like databases, APIs, and web applications
