- [Rock Paper Scissors](./01-beginner-projects/rock-paper-scissors): An interactive console game against the computer
    - A classic game implementation where players choose rock, paper, or scissors to compete against the computer's random choice.
    - Game Description
      In Rock Paper Scissors, players experience:
        1. Selecting their move by typing a number (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors)
        2. Seeing their choice displayed with ASCII art
        3. The computer randomly selects its move
        4. Game logic determines the winner based on traditional rules:
           - Rock crushes Scissors
           - Paper covers Rock
           - Scissors cut Paper
        5. Player sees the result (win, lose, or draw) with eye-catching ASCII art

      The game offers a visual experience with detailed ASCII art representations for each choice and outcome.

NOTES:

While Dr. Angela Yu's code uses less lines, it may be harder to read. But it is compact. Will take notes on her implementation and game logic.
