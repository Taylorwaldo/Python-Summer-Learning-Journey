# My 1st failed implementation ...

# What I did wrong...
# I was using the same index for each pop operation, didn't work because the list length changes
# each time you pop and element

# My 2st failed implementation...

    # Generate a new random index each time within the current list length

    password_list.append(popped_symbol)

#The error...
popped_symbol = symbols.pop(random_symbols_index)
IndexError: pop index out of range

# This error was happening because I was requesting more symbols than that were available in my symbols list
# I only have 9
# The issue was using pop(), it removes elements from the list, permanently. For what Dr Angela Yu had set me out to do...
# random.choice was the better option and pop() had made this alot harder than it needed to be, hence the struggle.

# random.choice() also allowed to reuse characters from each of it respective lists
