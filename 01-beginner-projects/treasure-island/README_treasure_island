Overview
This is a text-based adventure game created as part of Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course.
In this simple game, players make choices that determine whether they find the treasure or meet an unfortunate end.

Skills Practiced
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- User input handling
- String comparison
- ASCII art for visual feedback
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)

Problem that I had faced:
- I originally used == with 'and', != with 'or'
- Kept getting logic errors



### NOTES:

### For Multiple Equal Comparisons (==)

When you want to check if a value matches ANY of several possible values, you use or:
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| >>> if last_choice == "Red" or last_choice == "red":      |
| >>>     # Execute if either condition is true             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|

This reads naturally: "If last_choice equals 'Red' OR last_choice equals 'red', then..."
You want the code block to execute if EITHER condition is true... the user can type either "Red" or "red" to get the same result.

### For Multiple Not-Equal Comparisons (!=)
When you want to check if a value doesn't match ALL of several possible values, you use and:
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| >>> if first_choice != "left" and first_choice != "Left": |      |
| >>>     # Execute if either condition is true             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
This reads: "If first_choice is not 'left' AND first_choice is not 'Left', then..."
You want the code block to execute only if BOTH conditions are true... meaning the user typed neither "left" nor "Left".
